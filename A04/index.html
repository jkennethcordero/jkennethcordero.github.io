                        be used as a mouse in compatible games.


                        Nintendo will release Switch 2 on June 5, 2025, the company announced in April.

                    Key Features
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    Joy-Con 2
                </h3>
                <p class>
                    The newly designed Nintendo Switch 2 controllers, magnetically attach to the Nintendo
                    Switch 2 console. In addition, either Joy-Con 2 controller can be operated like a mouse by sliding
                    it on a surface like a table or on a pair of pants. They can be used in multiple ways, including for
                    games that require aiming.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Stand and a new USB-C port
                </h3>
                <p class>
                    The angle of the new stable stand on the back of the Nintendo Switch 2 system can be adjusted freely
                    so that players can find their preferred viewing angle. While Nintendo Switch has one USB-C port on
                    the bottom of the system, Nintendo Switch 2 has a port on the top of the system as well, which makes
                    it possible for players to use the included AC adapter to charge the system while playing in
                    tabletop mode. It is also possible to connect a compatible USB-C camera, like the Nintendo Switch 2
                    camera accessory to enjoy video chat on GameChat.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    GameShare
                </h3>
                <p class>
                    With GameShare, a new Nintendo Switch 2 feature, players can share and play the same game with
                    others who do not have the game. If one person has a Nintendo Switch 2 system and a game compatible
                    with GameShare, that person can invite others to temporarily play the same game together via local
                    play with their Nintendo Switch 2 or Nintendo Switch system. Between Nintendo Switch 2 systems,
                    GameShare can also be used along with GameChat for online play, so that players can chat with others
                    while all of them play the same game.
